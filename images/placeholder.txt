For a complete extension, you need to create the following icon files:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can use the generate_icons.html file in the root directory to help create these icons.

Alternatively, you can create your own icons using any image editing software and save them with these names in this directory.
